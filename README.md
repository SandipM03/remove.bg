#Ultimate Background Remover Tool.

#Reason for project:

After learning JavaScript and the DOM, I want to gain hands-on experience and practice my CSS skills. 
As a designer, I often need to use pictures without backgrounds, and visiting a website and signing in repeatedly can be cumbersome. 
Hence, I decided to create this project.
